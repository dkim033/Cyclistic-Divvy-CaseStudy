# Google Data Analytics Capstone Case Study
## How Does a Bike-Share Navigate Speedy Success? 

This Case Study was completed as part of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate.

### Scenario

You are a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations. 

1. Ask

To analyse how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently in order to design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.

2. Prepare

I used Cyclistic's historical trip data to analyze and identify trends. 

The data was downloaded directly from the Divvy Bikes website: https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html

It was organized by month, and assumed to be credible since it was compiled and published by the organization. There were some anomalies in the data, which was addressed in R script.

3. Process

Divvy datasets were uploaded and compared to find any anomalies. A new column for ride_length (in seconds) was created to compare ride length. Any data with negative ride_length were excluded from the final dataset. A full description of the process is described here: Divvy_Exercise Full Year Analysis.R

4. Analyse

Descriptive analysis on ride_length were performed and compared members and casual users. A full description of the process is described here: Divvy_Exercise Full Year Analysis.R

5. Share

Visualisations were created using Tableau. Published here 

6. Act 

A powerpoint presentation was compiled -
